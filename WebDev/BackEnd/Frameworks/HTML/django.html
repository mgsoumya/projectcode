    <p>Django is the web framework for perfectionists on a deadline. This Python-based web framework offers a clean and
    pragmatic way to build web apps. It’s appealing to the developers who take the time to produce clean code and the
    developers who want to move fast—but not break things. Web frameworks like Django provide the foundation to create this
    type of functionality with little to no coding. Before web frameworks, developers spent hours creating features for a
    new website from scratch. Developers realized that
    most functionality is the same from website to website.
    
    In the spirit of open-source collaboration, some experienced developers created web frameworks to standardize the
    development process. This makes it easier for other developers to build web applications quickly. In addition to Django,
    popular frameworks include Flask and Angular.
    
    Without a framework, a developer might spend months creating the necessary components to build a robust web application
    to handle user registration, login, database integration, and more.
    A feature unique to Django is the Object Relational Mapper (ORM). This tool integrates your app with relational
    databases without writing a single line of SQL code.
    
    Without ORM, one would write hundreds of lines of SQL to create the database tables for an application. This code would
    be specific to the database software and manually executed on any database attached to the project.
    
    Django reduces this work by providing a database-agnostic approach to structuring tables.
