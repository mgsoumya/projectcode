    <p>The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise
    applications - on any kind of deployment platform.
    
    A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of
    enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to
    specific deployment environments.
    Rod Johnson is the founder of the Spring Framework and a well-known expert on Java and J2EE.
    Rod holds a Ph.D. from Sydney University. Originally from a C/C++ background, he has been involved with Java and J2EE
    since their releases as a developer, architect, and consultant.
    <br>
    <br>
    He is the author of two of the most popular and influential books on J2EE: Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development
    (Wrox, 2002), and J2EE without EJB (Wrox, 2004, with Juergen Hoeller). Both have played a major role in the rise of
    “agile” J2EE, and the move away from overly complex traditional J2EE architecture.
    Rod is co-lead of the Spring Framework. He is a popular conference speaker and regularly appears at leading Java events
    in the US, Europe, and Asia. He serves in the Java Community Process (JCP) on the expert groups of several JSRs.
    He also has wide consulting experience in banking and finance, insurance, software, and media. He is CEO of Interface21
    (www.interface21.com), a consultancy devoted to providing expert J2EE and Spring Framework services.
    He is actively involved with client projects as well as Spring development.
