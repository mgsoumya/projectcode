    <p>Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming
    language.
    
    Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known
    as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and
    his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
    
    Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional
    software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc.
    AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications.
    An application that runs on the server side and creates a dynamic page is called a web application. Currently, Servlet,
    JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF, etc. technologies are used for creating web applications in Java.
    An application that is distributed in nature, such as banking applications, etc. is called an enterprise application. It
    has advantages like high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java, EJB is used for creating enterprise
    applications.</p>
