    <p>JavaScript is the scripting language of the Web.
    JavaScript is used in millions of Web pages to add functionality, validate forms, detect browsers, and
    much more. JavaScript is used in millions of Web pages to improve the design, validate forms, detect browsers, 
    create cookies, and much more. JavaScript is the most popular scripting language on the Internet, and 
    works in all major browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, and Opera.
    Java and JavaScript are two completely different languages in both concept and design!
    Java (developed by Sun Microsystems) is a powerful and much more complex programming language - in
    the same category as C and C++.
    JavaScript gives HTML designers a programming tool - HTML authors are normally not
    programmers, but JavaScript is a scripting language with a very simple syntax! Almost anyone can
    put small "snippets" of code into their HTML pages.</p>
