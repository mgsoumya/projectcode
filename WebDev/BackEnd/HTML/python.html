    <p>The huge popularity of Python programming language heavily relies on the unique features offered by it. Let’s have a
    look at the features of Python that set it apart from other programming languages.
    <br>
    Python is highly simple to get started with. It comes with a simple setup, easy to understand syntax and many practical
    applications that are heavily needed in web development. The syntax is relatively simple compared to other languages and
    a bunch of modules can be imported to make the code much shorter. There’re some straightforward, excellent tools
    available to work with Python code, particularly the interactive interpreter. It eliminates the need for learning
    special text editor, IDE, or anything else to begin using Python programming language. All you need to have a command
    prompt together with the interactive editor.
    <br>For a beginner in the programming domain, starting with a language which is difficult to learn not only slows the
    pace of the learning but brings additional complexity also. With Python programming language, a beginner can be
    introduced to the fundamental concepts like procedures and loops quickly and probably can work with user-defined objects
    in his/her initial stage of learning. Python’s hug syntactical simplicity lets a beginner use advanced or basic
    concepts, without much boilerplate code which is common in many other languages.
