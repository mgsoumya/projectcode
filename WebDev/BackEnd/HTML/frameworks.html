    <p>JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with tried and
    tested tools for building scalable, interactive web applications. Many modern companies use frameworks as a standard
    part of their tooling, so many front-end development jobs now require framework experience. In this set of articles, we
    are aiming to give you a comfortable starting point to help you begin learning frameworks.
    A JavaScript framework is a collection of JavaScript code libraries that provide a web developer with pre-written code
    for routine programming tasks. Frameworks are structures with a particular context and help you create web applications
    within that context. JavaScript is a powerful coding language used in both frontend and backend development.
    
    It is completely possible to build strong web applications without JavaScript frameworks, but frameworks provide a
    template that handles common programming patterns. Each time you have to build an application, you donâ€™t need to write
    code for every single feature from scratch. Instead, you can build upon an existing feature set.
    
    All JavaScript frameworks, like most other frameworks, provide some rules and guidelines. Using these rules and
    guidelines, any developer can make complex applications faster and more efficiently than if they decided to build from
    scratch. The rules and guidelines help shape and organize your website or web application too!
