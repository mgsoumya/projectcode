    <p>MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL (Not only SQL) is used as an alternative to
    traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data.
    MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.
    
    MongoDB is used for high-volume data storage, helping organizations store large amounts of data while still performing
    rapidly. Organizations also use MongoDB for its ad-hoc queries, indexing, load balancing, aggregation, server-side
    JavaScript execution and other features.

    Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standardized programming language that is used to manage relational databases. SQL
    normalizes data as schemas and tables, and every table has a fixed structure.
    
    Instead of using tables and rows as in relational databases, as a NoSQL database, the MongoDB architecture is made up of
    collections and documents. Documents are made up of Key-value pairs -- MongoDB's basic unit of data. Collections, the
    equivalent of SQL tables, contain document sets. MongoDB offers support for many programming languages, such as C, C++,
    C#, Go, Java, Python, Ruby and Swift.
