    <p>SQL is easy to learn as the statements comprise of descriptive English words and are not case sensitive. We can create
    and interact with a database using SQL in an efficient and easy way. The benefit with SQL is that we donâ€™t have to
    specify how to get the data from the database. Rather, we simply specify what is to be retrieved, and SQL does the rest.
    Although called a query
    language, SQL can do much more besides querying SQL provides statements for defining the structure of the data,
    manipulating data in the database, declare constraints and retrieve data from the database in various ways, depending on
    our requirements.

    In this chapter, we will learn how to create a database using MySQL as the RDBMS software. We will create a database
    called StudentAttendance (Figure 7.5) that we
    had identified in the previous chapter. We will also learn how to populate database with data, manipulate data in that
    and retrieve data from the database through SQL.
    MySQL is an open source RDBMS software which can easily downloaded from the official website https://
    dev.mysql.com/downloads. After installing MySQL, start MySQL service. The appearance of mysql> prompt
    means that MySQL is ready for us to enter SQL statements.
