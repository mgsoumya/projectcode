    <p>HTML is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content,
    for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos
    in the page. HTML is an important language to learn if anyone wants to work in the web development domain [Web
    designers, Web Developers]. HTML alone is not sufficient for a web developer because HTML only defines the structure of
    the data that will be rendered on the browser in a webpage, to make it visually appealing and to make it functional, we
    will need to use CSS and Javascript respectively.</p>
    <p>In HTML, a blank sequence of whitespace characters is treated as a single space character, Because the browser collapses
    multiple spaces into a single space character and this helps a developer to indent lines of text without worrying about
    multiple spaces and maintain readability and understandability of HTML codes.</p>
