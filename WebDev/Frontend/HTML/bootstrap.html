    <p>Since Bootstrap launched in August 2011, it has taken off in popularity. It has evolved
        from being an entirely CSS-driven project to include a host of JavaScript plugins and
        icons that go hand in hand with forms and buttons. At its base, it allows for responsive
        web design and features a robust 12-column, 940px-wide grid. One of the highlights is
        the build tool on Bootstrapâ€™s website, where you can customize the build to suit your
        needs, choosing which CSS and JavaScript features you want to include on your site. All
        of this allows frontend web development to be catapulted forward, building on a stable
        foundation of forward-looking design and development. Getting started with Bootstrap
        is as simple as dropping some CSS and JavaScript into the root of your site.
        For someone starting a new project, Bootstrap comes with a handful of useful elements.
